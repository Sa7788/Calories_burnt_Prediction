# Calories_burnt_Prediction
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the number of calories burned during exercise based on user input parameters such as age, gender, BMI, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature. It utilizes a trained Random Forest Regressor model to make these predictions and provides visual comparisons.
